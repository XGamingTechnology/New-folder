5. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   - Add your script and README file to the repository, commit, and push the changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit with script and README"
     git push origin main
     ```

By following these steps, you'll have a well-documented GitHub repository that others can easily understand and use. If you need any further help with GitHub or any other aspect, feel free to ask!
